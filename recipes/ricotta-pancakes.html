    <h1>Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes</h1>
    <img src="../img/pancakes.jpg" width="300" height="300">
    <p><strong>If these pancakes were any lighter, they would float off the plate and I didn't even separate the eggs and whip the whites.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Also, I used water instead of milk, and I liked them better that way.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>I like to serve these with a pat of butter, a pinch of lemon zest, and a drizzle of maple syrup.</strong></p>
    
    <h2>Ingredientes:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup cold water or milk</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (just the yellow part of the skin)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons self-rising flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Step 1</b></dt>
        <dd>Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese, lemon zest, vegetables oil, sugar, egg, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix. Add melted butter, lemon juice, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour. Whisk together, stirring until most of flour disappears into the batter.</dd>
        <dt><b>Step 2</b></dt>
        <dd>Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes.</dd>
        <dt><b>Step 3</b></dt>
        <dd>Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Portion out 1/4 cup scoops of batter onto skillet (cook in batches). When bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges of the pancakes start to look dry (2 to 3 minutes), flip and cook other side until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate.</dd>
        <dt><b>Step 4</b></dt>
        <dd>Enjoy your meal!!!</dd>
